 Rapid APT Zysroot (why not)
-----------------------------

Is a small collection of scripts. The basic structure is like this

Directory structure
-------------------

top-dir
 +- raptz<cmd>		- The scripts that can be used. See "./raptz help"
 +- default -> <confdir>	- A soft link pointing to the default confdir
 +- <confdir>		- The name of the sysroot (emdebian). 
 |  +- multistrap.cfg   - The multistrap configuration file
 |  +- root             - Extra root files for the enviroment
 |  +- conf             - Configuration files
 |     +-<nn><name>     - Configuration directory
 |       +- init.sh     - Optional init script
 |       +- init.dev.sh - Optional init script for development
 +- lib                 - Common files for all raptz<cmd> scripts.
    +- ui.<name>.inc    - UI output script
    +- common.inc       - Common inclution.


Basics to get a sysroot (raptz mksys)
=====================================

The raptz<cmd> scripts are to be used with the "raptz" program. They shall
only create and update a sysroot. Everything needed for a sysroot is defined
in the <confdir> directory.


Step 1 - Multistrap (raptz strap)
---------------------------------

The <confdir>/multistrap.cfg file is used when multistrapping. Default
location of sysroot is /opt/<confdir>
The <confdir>/multistrap.cfg file should only contain the absolute basics for
your sysroot. Install extra packages with raptz script described below.


Step 2 - Copy extra needed files to sysroot (raptz strap)
---------------------------------------------------------

Since multistrapping does not setup a complete system (configuration on target
architecture is needed for example)

After multistrapping the <confdir>/root folder is copied to the / sysroot. Files 
are copyed if newer than the file on sysroot or it does not exist on sysroot. 
This move makes them a part of the main sysroot.


Step 3 - Execute raptz script in qemu chroot (raptz conf)
----------------------------------------------------------

After the move each directory in <confdir>/conf/ folder is mounted on a temporary 
directory in the sysroot and it's init scripts will be executed in a qemu enviroment.
The number of the directory name specified the order of execution.
Execution is done within a qemu-static chroot with the temporary directory included
with the first argument. 

Installing SysRoot to SD-Card
=============================

This may be done with the rapt inst call.
