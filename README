Is a small collection of scripts. 

Directory structure
-------------------

top-dir
 +- default -> <confdir> - A soft link pointing to the default confdir
 +- <confdir>            - The name of the sysroot (emdebian). 
 |  +- multistrap.cfg    - The multistrap configuration file
 |  +- root              - Extra root files for the enviroment
 |  +- conf              - Configuration files
 |     +-<nn><name>      - Configuration directory
 |       +- init.sh      - Optional init script
 |       +- init.dev.sh  - Optional init script for development
 +- ui                   - UIs folder
    +- <name>ui.inc      - UI output script
    +- baseui.inc        - Common ui.


Basics to get a sysroot (raptz mksys)
=====================================

Step 1 - Multistrap (raptz mksys)
---------------------------------

The <confdir>/multistrap.cfg file is used when multistrapping. Default
location of sysroot is /opt/<confdir>
The <confdir>/multistrap.cfg file should only contain the absolute basics for
your sysroot. Install extra packages with raptz script described below.


Since multistrapping does not setup a complete system (configuration on target
architecture is needed for example) after multistrapping the <confdir>/root folder is copied to the sysroot. Files 
are copyed if newer than the file on sysroot or it does not exist on sysroot. 
This move makes them a part of the main sysroot.

After the each directory in <confdir>/conf/ folder is copied to a temporary 
directory in the sysroot and it's init scripts will be executed in a qemu enviroment.
The number of the directory name specified the order of execution.
Execution is done within a qemu-static chroot with the temporary directory included
with the first argument.
